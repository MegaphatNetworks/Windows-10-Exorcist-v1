If you do and you do not give me 50% of what you charge, you are nasty and
deserve to be sued by your customer for theft.  You may **NOT** make any 
modifications to any portion of the code and maintain any notice that it 
is from Megaphat Networks because that would mean your weak-ass coding 
could damage the work I've done and if things go bad because of your 
crappy mods, you're looking to blame me!  **Hells No!!!**

If you're gonna do that, just rip my code entirely, slap your own name 
on it, and mod it all you want but do NOT associate me with you if you're 
ripping on me.  Just don't!
